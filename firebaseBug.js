The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided `options` object in the `initializeApp` function contains unexpected properties or if required properties are missing.  For example, if you misspell a property name like `credential` as `credentil`, or omit the `apiKey` property, the initialization will fail silently or throw a cryptic error. The error message isn't always clear in pinpointing the exact cause, especially when dealing with nested objects within the options.
